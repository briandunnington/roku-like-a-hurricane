## About This Blog

Roku development can be challenging. There is an entirely new language to learn, fewer tools, and a smaller ecosystem
and community around it than other platforms. But there are lots of tips and tricks out there that folks have
discovered/developed that can save lots of headaches and maybe even make Roku development a little fun. This blog
hopes to collect and document those nuggets of wisdom and contribute to our overall collective knowledge.

# About Me

I have developed Roku apps for some of the biggest names on the platform, including HBO, Hulu, TBS/TNT, Dolby, iHeartRadio,
and many more. Through trial-and-error, experimentation, research, and collaboration, I have built up a library of tools
and patterns that have made my Roku development experience much better. You can find out more about me and some of my
